name: keyboard-accessibility
description: >
  Load this skill for any project with interactive UI, such as buttons, links, forms, modals, dropdowns, menus, tabs, sliders, toolbars, carousels, or custom widgets, in React or vanilla JavaScript. Never ship an interactive element that cannot be fully operated by keyboard alone. Always ensure a visible focus indicator, logical tab order, correct widget key behavior, and no keyboard traps. Targets WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

# Keyboard accessibility

Apply these rules to every interactive element and feature. Examples are React-first. Vanilla JavaScript is shown only where it differs meaningfully. The detailed rules and code examples are bundled under `./reference/`. Read the relevant file before applying or citing a rule.

## Core mandate

All interactive functionality must be fully usable with a keyboard alone, with no mouse or touch required, except where the function genuinely depends on path-based movement (for example, freehand drawing). Keyboard access is not the same as "can Tab to it": native and composite widgets use different key conventions, and users must be able to reach, operate, and leave every component.

## Severity scale

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical** | Blocks task completion entirely for keyboard and assistive technology (AT) users |
| **Serious** | Significantly impairs keyboard access, with no reasonable workaround |
| **Moderate** | Creates friction, but a workaround exists |
| **Minor** | Best-practice gap with marginal impact |

Judge severity by the actual effect on the task, not the rule alone: can the user reach, operate, and leave the component; is an essential task blocked; is focus lost or placed misleadingly.

## Reference map

The rules and code examples are bundled under `./reference/`. Read the relevant file before applying or citing a rule. Severity reflects the impact when the rule is violated.

- Critical rules:
   - [reference/native-elements.md](./reference/native-elements.md) — Use native, keyboard-reachable elements
   - [reference/keyboard-traps.md](./reference/keyboard-traps.md) — No keyboard trap
   - [reference/widget-keys.md](./reference/widget-keys.md) — Expected key behaviors
   - [reference/dialogs.md](./reference/dialogs.md) — Dialog focus management
- Serious rules:
   - [reference/focus-visibility.md](./reference/focus-visibility.md) — Focus visibility
   - [reference/focus-not-obscured.md](./reference/focus-not-obscured.md) — Focus not obscured
   - [reference/focus-order.md](./reference/focus-order.md) — Focus order
   - [reference/composite-widgets.md](./reference/composite-widgets.md) — Composite widgets (roving tabindex)
   - [reference/visibility-mechanisms.md](./reference/visibility-mechanisms.md) — `aria-hidden` versus `hidden` versus `inert`
- Moderate rules:
   - [reference/skip-links.md](./reference/skip-links.md) — Skip link and landmarks
   - [reference/navigation-and-notifications.md](./reference/navigation-and-notifications.md) — Navigation and notification focus
   - [reference/input-alternatives.md](./reference/input-alternatives.md) — Character-key shortcuts, touch, and pointer
- Testing:
   - [reference/checklist.md](./reference/checklist.md) — Testing checklist and automated-tool limits
